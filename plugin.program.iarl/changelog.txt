Internet Archive ROM Launcher Change Log
11-01-2017
Fix error in file size for some games in listings (thanks nerdflix)
Updated setup wizard, should be more seamless for first time users now
Fixed wizard for slower machines that would appear to not be working when the wizard started (thanks sublinhado)
Added a Terms of Use page when add-on is first run
Updated ROM Window to inhibit buttons after download or launch are pressed, to avoid double presses
Fix failure to launch game if xml file is present (thanks garbear)
Updated external launchers, renamed so they’re in line with current options.  Will update wiki accordingly
Updated external command database.  Made a script to generate this database so it should stay in line with libretro builedbot more readily
Added Game and Watch list
Added Lutro Game list
Added Phillips CD-i (117 Games Filtered, 625 Unfiltered)… Possibly the worst gaming system of all time?
Add softlist launching functions for games with no launch file (only required for CD-i for now)
Fix some search window stuff
Fix for error in launching previously downloaded DOSBox games (thanks myuubie)
Updated ColecoVision game list, now launches with default BlueMSX core and works really well!
Updated MSX, split into two game lists:
MSX1 (384 Games / 937 Games Unfiltered)
MSX2 (131 Games / 197 Games Unfiltered)
